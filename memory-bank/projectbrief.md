# Project Brief: ynsta.github.io Tools Collection

## Overview
A personal collection of web-based tools hosted on GitHub Pages at https://ynsta.github.io/. Each tool serves a specific utility purpose and is primarily created with GenAI assistance.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Tool Gallery**: Main landing page displaying all available tools
2. **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic detection of new tools added to the repository
3. **Individual Tools**: Each tool is self-contained in its own directory
4. **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Static site deployment via GitHub Pages

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Consistent Theme**: Dark glassmorphism design by default
2. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
3. **No Backend**: All tools must be client-side only (GitHub Pages limitation)
4. **Easy Addition**: Simple process to add new tools

## Project Goals
1. Create a centralized hub for personal utility tools
2. Maintain consistency across tools while allowing flexibility
3. Enable rapid tool development with GenAI assistance
4. Provide useful utilities accessible from anywhere via web

## Constraints
- Static hosting only (no server-side processing)
- Must work within GitHub Pages limitations
- Tools should be standalone and not require external dependencies
- All processing must happen client-side

## Success Criteria
- Tools are easily discoverable from the main page
- Each tool functions independently
- New tools can be added without modifying existing code
- Consistent user experience across all tools
